 The Fire Breathes lyrics

The fire breathes 
The fire breathes 
It grows and grows and seems to have no end 

The fire breathes 
The fire feeds 
Search and search, consuming everything it sees 

[Chorus:]
It lives inside of me 
Burning, burning, burning (yeah, yeah) 
It lives inside of me 
The fire breathes 

The fire breathes 
The fire breathes 
The beauty in its violence brings me peace 

The fire breathes 
The fire breeds 
It lives in hearts, causing strength to believe 

[CHORUS]

The fire breathes 
And I need 
Life in this dead man to make me free 

[CHORUS (repeat)]
