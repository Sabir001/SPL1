TESTING HYPOTHESIS
Hypothesis:-
A statistical hypothesis is an assertion or statement about a population or equivalently about the probability distribution characterizing a population, which we want to verify on the basis of information contained in a sample.
Examples:-
A physician may hypothesize that the recommended drug is effective in 90 percent cases.
A sewing machine company claims that their new machine is superior to the one available in the market.
Test of a statistical hypothesis:-
A test of a statistical hypothesis is a two-action decision problem after the experimental sample values have been obtained, the two-actions being the acceptance or rejection of the hypothesis under consideration.
Null hypothesis:-
Null means the possible rejection of the hypothesis. Null hypothesis is a statement, which tells us that no difference exists between the parameter and the statistic being compared to it. Null hypothesis is always denoted by
Example:-
There is no difference in the population between the rates of prevalence of malnutrition between the male and female children.
Alternative hypothesis:-
The alternative hypothesis is the logical opposite of the null hypothesis. Alternative hypothesis is usually denoted by
or
Example:-
There exists significant difference in the population between the rates of prevalence of malnutrition between the male and female children.
: There is no association between level of education and knowledge of child nutrition among women.
: The level of education and knowledge of child nutrition among women are associated.
Simple hypothesis:-
If a hypothesis completely specifies the distribution of a population, it is called a simple hypothesis. Suppose, for example, that a coin is tossed 30 times (
) to determine whether the coin is an ideal one. Then, the hypothesis
is a simple hypothesis since it completely specifies the population distribution.
Composite hypothesis:-
If a hypothesis does not completely specify the population distribution completely, it is called a composite hypothesis. In the above coin-tossing example, if we do not specify that
, then the hypothesis
would be a composite hypothesis.
One-tailed test:-
A test of any statistical hypothesis where the alternative is one-sided such as
or perhaps,
is called a one-sided test.
Two-tailed test:-
A test of any statistical hypothesis where the alternative is two-sided such as
is called a two-tailed test.
Type I error:-
The error of rejecting
(accepting
) when
is true is called type I error. The probability of type I error is denoted by
and it is called the level of significance.
Type II error:-
The error of accepting
when
is false (
is true) is called type II error. The probability of type II error is denoted by
Status of Ho
Ho true
Ho false
Accept Ho
Correct decision
Type II error
Reject Ho
Type I error
Correct decision
Power of the test:-
, that is the probability of rejecting
when
is false (
is true) is called the power of the test hypothesis
against the alternative hypothesis
Critical region or rejection region:-
A  region of rejection is a set of possible values of the sample statistic, which provides evidence to contradict the null hypothesis and leads to a decision to reject the null hypothesis.
Acceptance region:-
A region of acceptance is a set of possible values of the sample statistic, which provides evidence to support the null hypothesis and lead to a decision to accept it.
Test statistic:-
The statistic used to provide evidence about the null hypothesis is called the test statistic.
Five step procedures for testing a hypothesis:-
Step1:Set Up null hypothesis(Ho) and the alternate hypothesis(H1):
Null hypothesis:
A statement about the value of a population parameter.
Alternate hypothesis:
A statement that is accepted if the sample data provide sufficient evidence that null hypothesis is false.
The following example will help clarify what is meant by the null hypothesis and the alternate hypothesis. A recent article indicated the mean age of US commercial aircraft is 15 years. To conduct a statistical test regarding this estimate, the first step is to determine the null and the alternate hypothesis.
The null hypothesis represents the current or reported condition. it is written by Ho:
=15
The alternate hypothesis is that the statement is not true, that is writtenbyH1:
15
It is important to remember that no matter how the problem is stated; the null hypothesis will always contain the equal sign. We turn to the alternate hypothesis only if the data suggests the null hypothesis is untrue.
Step2: select level of significance:
Level of significance is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true. The level of significance is denoted by the Greek letter alpha. It is also sometimes called the level of risk.There is no one level of significance that is applied to all tests. Traditionally .o5 level is selected for the consumer  research project, .01 for quality assurance and  .10 for political polling.
Step 3: select the test statistic:
A value, determined from sample information, used to determine whether to reject the null hypothesis. Every test statistic follows a particular distribution under null hypothesis. They usually follow Z, t, F and so on.
Step 4: set decision rule:
A decision rule is a statement of conditions under which the null hypothesis rejected or the conditions under which it is not rejected. In this step, we are to define acceptance and rejection region of Ho.
Step 5: decision making and interpretation:
The last step is to make decision on the basis of the calculated value of test statistic to find it we are to take random sample.
