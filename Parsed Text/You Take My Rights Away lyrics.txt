 You Take My Rights Away lyrics

You take my rights away 
You take control, No stopping You 
You take my rights away 
I can take it 

See me let it go 
You are in control 
Suffer as we grow 
And we say - we say we don't want to 

Holding nothing 
You take everything 
You're worth anything at all 
Anything at all 

[CHORUS (repeat)]

You define me 
With your identity 
Lose my life in You 
I can take - I'll take what it costs me 

[CHORUS (repeat)]
