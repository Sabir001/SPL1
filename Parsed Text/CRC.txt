Identify the classes from the requirements provided below. 
An MIS software for XYZ LimitedThere are 170 field stations to collect Malaria patients information. 170 field stations are located in 170 Upazillas and having 170 field officers to gather field level data. The data that the field officers need to collect are – Patient’s namePatient’s agePatient’s sexPatient’s addressDuration of the disease Medication takenCurrent conditionThe field officers will collect the data from the field operators (each of the Upazilla will have 5 operators), and send the information through a web interface to the Central Database (CDB) located at the Dhaka station. All the communications to the CDB must be authenticated.The Project Manager (PM) will be able to query the CDB for generating reports, such as Age group vulnerable to malariaArea vulnerable to malariaPatient condition Vs Disease durationEffect of Medication in the course of timeBased on those reports, PM should be able to send Upazilla wise decisions to the field officers that need to be taken through the MIS software.Unimportant/Generic diagrams can be avoided all together (For example, Authentication System or Collection of Data from the field operators need not be analyzed).

Good Luck!!!
